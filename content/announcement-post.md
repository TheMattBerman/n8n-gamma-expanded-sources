# Announcement Post: Competitor Playbook Generator

## X (Twitter) Version

### Main Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
```
I built an AI that steals any competitor's playbook in 60 seconds.

Input a URL → Get a full deck with their:
- Positioning strategy
- Messaging hooks
- Content gaps
- Ad psychology
- How to beat them

Giving away the n8n workflow free. Here's how it works 🧵
```

**Tweet 2 (The Problem)**
```
Most competitive analysis takes hours.

You're manually:
- Browsing their website
- Screenshotting their ads
- Reading their blog posts
- Taking notes in Google Docs

And by the time you're done, the intel is already stale.
```

**Tweet 3 (The Solution)**
```
This workflow does it in 60 seconds:

1. Firecrawl scrapes their website (homepage, about, pricing, blog)
2. Claude analyzes positioning, messaging, content, ads
3. @Gammaapp generates a polished presentation deck

One click → Full competitive playbook.
```

**Tweet 4 (What You Get)**
```
The output is a 9-slide Gamma deck:

→ Executive Summary (threat level + key insights)
→ Positioning Analysis (value prop, audience, differentiators)
→ Messaging Breakdown (hooks, proof elements, brand voice)
→ Content Strategy (pillars, formats, top performers)
→ Ad Psychology (patterns, triggers, CTAs)
→ Gaps & Opportunities (where they're vulnerable)
→ How to Beat Them (quick wins + ad ideas)
```

**Tweet 5 (Use Cases)**
```
How I'm using it:

→ Outreach: "I ran your competitor through our AI - here's what I found"
→ Client kickoffs: Auto-generate competitive audits
→ Research: Instant GTM breakdowns for newsletter content
→ Sales: Hyper-personalized pitch decks

It's genuinely changed how I do competitive research.
```

**Tweet 6 (Social Proof / Results)**
```
Ran it on 10 companies yesterday.

Average generation time: 47 seconds
Analysis quality: Better than most human audits
Cost per analysis: ~$0.15 (API costs)

The ROI is insane.
```

## LinkedIn Version

```
I built an AI agent that steals any competitor's playbook in 60 seconds.

Here's what it does:

You input a competitor URL.

The AI:
→ Scrapes their website (homepage, about, pricing, blog)
→ Analyzes their positioning, messaging, content strategy
→ Identifies gaps and opportunities
→ Generates a full presentation deck with actionable insights

60 seconds later, you have a professional competitive intelligence report.

---

The tech stack:

• Firecrawl for website scraping
• Claude for competitive analysis
• Gamma for deck generation

All orchestrated through n8n.

---

What you get in the deck:

1. Executive Summary - Threat level + 5 key insights
2. Positioning Analysis - Value prop, audience, differentiators
3. Messaging Breakdown - Hooks, proof elements, brand voice
4. Content Strategy - Pillars, formats, distribution
5. Ad Psychology - Patterns, triggers, CTAs
6. Gaps & Opportunities - Where they're vulnerable
7. How to Beat Them - Quick wins, positioning plays, ad ideas

---

Why this matters:

Traditional competitive analysis takes hours.

This takes 60 seconds.

And the output is better than most human audits because:
- It's systematic (never misses a section)
- It's objective (no confirmation bias)
- It's actionable (specific recommendations, not generic insights)

---

How I'm using it:

→ Cold outreach: "I ran your competitor through our AI..."
→ Client kickoffs: Auto-generate competitive audits
→ Content research: Instant GTM breakdowns
→ Sales decks: Hyper-personalized pitch materials

---

Want the workflow?

I'm giving it away free.

Comment "PLAYBOOK" and I'll send you:
• The n8n workflow JSON
• Setup documentation
• Claude prompt templates
• Gamma deck structure

This is what AI automation looks like in 2025.
